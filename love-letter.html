<h1>My Love Letter to You, Kate ❤️</h1>

<p>
My dearest Kate Abena Serwaa,  
<br><br>
From the moment you came into my life, something inside me shifted.  
You brought softness where there was stress, joy where there was tiredness,  
and a kind of peace I never knew I needed until I found it in you.  
<br><br>
You are not just special — you are rare.  
The way you smile, the way you talk, the way you care…  
It all stays with me long after the moment has passed.  
<br><br>
Every day, I find new reasons to appreciate you.  
Your strength.  
Your kindness.  
Your beautiful heart.  
Your gentle soul.  
<br><br>
I want you to know this:  
No matter how life turns, I’m here.  
With you.  
For you.  
Always.  
<br><br>
Happy Birthday, my love.  
This world is brighter because you’re in it.  
And my world is complete because I have you.  
<br><br>
❤️ With love, always.  
</p>
